# Effects of Traumatic Brain Injury on Cognition 

This is the Python code for my master's thesis. For this project, I had to investigate any relationship between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and human executive functions. Using software called FreeSurfer, I collected brain anatomical measurements (cortical thickness, surface area, volume) for the subjects' MRI data. Using these anatomical measurements, I created structural covariance networks (SCNs) to analyze the graphical properties of the brain. Three graph theory parameters were used in the data analysis: nodal degree, average clustering coefficient, and average shortest path length. Neuropsychological test score data was also utilized to quantitate the subjects' executive function performance. Specifically, the Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT) was used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference. By combining the neuropsychological data and the graph theory parameters, linear regression analyses were performed to observe any correlational relationships. The only regression models that had accurate and precise results were the surface area-shortest path models.
